# gget

A small utility for getting files from git repositories.

## Command Line

Provide the repository you want to download from as the first argument. By default, all user-uploaded assets of the latest release will be downloaded.

    gget github.com/gohugoio/hugo

Include a tag to download files from something other than the latest published version.

    gget github.com/gohugoio/hugo@v0.63.1

Provide file names (or globs) as additional arguments to limit the files are downloaded.

    gget github.com/gohugoio/hugo 'hugo_extended_*_Linux-ARM.deb'

Use the `--exclude=` option to avoid files with overlapping matches.

    gget github.com/gohugoio/hugo --exclude='*extended*' 'hugo_*_Linux-ARM.deb'

Prefix remote file names with a custom local file path to use an alternative download location. Use the `--exec` option to mark a download as executable.

    gget --exec github.com/stedolan/jq /usr/local/bin/jq=jq-osx-amd64

Use the `--type=` option to download files other than user-uploaded release assets. Use `archive` to access zip or tarball archives of the repository files.

    gget --type=archive github.com/stedolan/jq '*.zip'

Use the `blob` type to download individual repository files. In addition to tags, branch and commit references may be used for these types.

    gget --type=blob github.com/stedolan/jq@jq-1.5-branch README.md

Use `--help` to see all options and learn more about advanced usage.

    gget --help
